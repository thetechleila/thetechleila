üóΩ **Interactive 2016-2024 NYC Public High School Student Performance Dashboard**

My teammates and I are analyzing the data of NYC Public High School students from 2016-2024 to find patterns, trends, and insights into the effects the Covid-19 Lockdown had on educational outcomes across diverse student populations.

**Our end goal** is to design a comprehensive data dashboard that provides up-to-date information on NYC Student Performance with accurate data on socio-economic and demographic factors that may negatively or positively impact education outcomes. 

*Deliverables include:*

* Comprehensive EDA of NYC Public High School student demographics, chronic absenteeism, Regents scores, graduation outcomes, etc. using datasets from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
* Jupyter Notebooks to showcase EDA
* Data transformation via proper project oriented programming principles
* ETL Pipeline creation 
* Creation of SQL Database to store cleaned and transformed project data
* Creation of Single Source of Truth table for usage in Tableau


üçé **Interactive 2016-2024 NYC Public K-8 Student Performance Dashboard**

I am working on this as a companion project to the NYC Public High School analysis currently underway with my teammates.

Data on NYC K-8 students from 2016-2024 will be analyzed to find trends and insights into the possible effects the Covid-19 Lockdown had on educational outcomes and other metrics throughout the diverse student population.

**My end goal** is to design an in-depth data dashboard that will provide a high level look into how the various factors that may have influenced student performance, enrollment, and demographic metrics.

*Deliverables include*

* Detailed EDA of NYC Public K-8 student demographics, ELA (English Language Arts) & NYS Math Test scores across groups, enrollment, poverty and economic need indices using datasets from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).
* Jupyter Notebooks to showcase EDA
* Data transformation using Excel/Numbers 
* Creation of processed dataset(s) for usage in Tableau
