## Recently Completed Project(s)

🗽 **Interactive 2016-2024 NYC Public High School Student Performance Dashboard**

My teammates and I have analyzed the data of NYC Public High School students from 2016-2024 to find patterns, trends, and insights into the effects the Covid-19 Lockdown had on educational outcomes across diverse student populations.

**Our end goal** was to design a comprehensive data dashboard that provides up-to-date information on NYC Student Performance with accurate data on socio-economic and demographic factors that may negatively or positively impact education outcomes. 

*Deliverables include:*

* Comprehensive EDA of NYC Public High School student demographics, chronic absenteeism, Regents scores, graduation outcomes, etc. using datasets from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
* Jupyter Notebooks to showcase EDA
* Data transformation via proper project oriented programming principles
* ETL Pipeline creation 
* Creation of SQL Database to store cleaned and transformed project data
* Creation of Single Source of Truth table for usage in Tableau

**Check out the Interactive Tableau Dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rosselyn.oliva/viz/HighSchoolStudentPerformanceinNYC/Dashboard1) and take a look out the [Repository](https://github.com/thetechleila/NYC-Public-High-School-Student-Performance-2016-to-2024) for further details.**

🏫 **Interactive NYC Public High School and K-8 Enrollment from 2015-2024 Dashboards**

Take a deeper look specifically at how enrollment has changed across grade level and various demographic groups compared with the rates of poverty across NYC's Five Boroughs with the two interactive Tableau Dashboards I've created below:
