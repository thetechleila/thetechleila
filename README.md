**Interactive NYC Public School Student Performance Dashboard**

My teammates and I are analyzing the data of K-12 NYC Public School students from 2015-2024 to find patterns, trends, and insights into the effects the Covid-19 Pandemic/Lockdown had on educational outcomes. 

**Our end goal** is to design a comprehensive data dashboard that provides up-to-date information on NYC Student Performance with accurate data on socio-economic and demographic factors that may negatively or positively impact education outcomes. 

*Deliverables include:*

* Comprehensive EDA of NYC K-12 Public School student demographics, chronic absenteeism, SAT & Regents scores, ELA & Math Assessment results, graduation outcomes, etc. using datasets from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
* Jupyter Notebook to showcase EDA
* Data transformation via proper project oriented programming principles
* ETL Pipeline creation 
* Creation of SQL Database to store cleaned and transformed project data
